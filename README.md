Hello

This is my folders of Machine Learning projects I've learned last year or so.
The folders consists of pyhton file and corresponding Orange Data Mining file.

It sometimes contains file from various websites such as Kaggle, SKLearn, and HuggingFace.
(The ODM files might be errored when downloaded because the dataset might have not been downloaded)
